  /**
   * Creates a new, safely-serializable function from a provided (serializable) function if it is method reference
   * (e.g. Object::toString),  or simply returns the passed function if it is a function object.  If this is something
   * not safely serializable (e.g. a lambda), an exception will be thrown.
   *
   * "Safely-serializable" means that a function can be deserialized in a way that is not inherently brittle.
   * We recommend only serializing functions when they are safely-serializable, but note that this is not a guarantee;
   * as with Serializable objects in general it's always possible to create something (safely-)serializable that will
   * not serialize, e.g. an instance method with a captured instance (e.g. new Object()::toString) where the captured
   * instance is not itself serializable.
   *
   * Function objects that wrap functions and implement DoubleFunction0.Serializable should override this method
   * when appropriate.  Generally such an implementation will simply create a new instance wrapping
   * wrappedFunction.safelySerializable() instead of wrappedFunction.
   *
   * Anonymous lambdas, such as "{@code a -> a + 5}", are *not* safely-serializable, even if they are technically
   * serializable, as they are extraordinarily fragile and will only deserialize correctly under these conditions:
   * (1) the class in which they were created must exist in both serializing and deserializing programs.
   * (2) the ORDER in which the lambdas are defined must not change.  The names of the generated anonymous classes are
   * dependent upon the position in which the lambda appears in the file!
   * (3) the JVM should be consistent, as different JVMs are in principle free to generate different class names.
