   * serializable, as they are extraordinarily fragile and will only deserialize correctly under these conditions:
   * (1) the class in which they were created must exist in both serializing and deserializing programs.
   * (2) the ORDER in which the lambdas are defined must not change.  The names of the generated anonymous classes are
   * dependent upon the position in which the lambda appears in the file!
